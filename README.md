In Depth Discription:

About me (main page):
    The landing page is a quick look at who I am professionally and some small personal details. This also allows the user to put a name with a face. 
The navbar displayed here also has links to a portfolio, Linked In, and Github.

Portfolio:
    This displays all of the work I would say is my best thus far in my journey. I would like to add another link to my architectual and design work so 
the viewer can get a sense of everything I enjoy doing. This also includes my resume so they can get a more indepth look at my professional experience.
